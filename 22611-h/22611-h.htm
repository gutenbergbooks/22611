    THE FOX AND THE GEESE.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   <span class="sc">There</span> was once a Goose at the point of death, </p>
<p class="i4">     So she called her three daughters near, </p>
<p class="i2">   And desired them all, with her latest breath, </p>
<p class="i4">     Her last dying words to hear. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Mr. Fox,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I know, </p>
<p class="i4">     Who lives in a covert hard by; </p>
<p class="i2">   To our race he has proved a deadly foe, </p>
<p class="i4">     So beware of his treachery. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Build houses, ere long, of stone or of bricks, </p>
<p class="i4">     And get tiles for your roofs, I pray; </p>
<p class="i2">   For I know, of old, Mr. Reynard&rsquo;s tricks, </p>
<p class="i4">     And I fear he may come any day.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Thus saying, she died, and her daughters fair,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     Gobble, Goosey, and Ganderee,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   Agreed together, that they would beware </p>
<p class="i4">     Of Mr. Fox, their enemy. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But Gobble, the youngest, I grieve to say, </p>
<p class="i4">     Soon came to a very bad end, </p>
<p class="i2">   Because she preferred her own silly way, </p>
<p class="i4">     And would not to her mother attend. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   For she made, with some boards, an open nest, </p>
<p class="i4">     For a roof took the lid of a box; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then quietly laid herself down to rest, </p>
<p class="i4">     And thought she was safe from the Fox. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But Reynard, in taking an evening run, </p>
<p class="i4">     Soon scented the goose near the pond; </p>
<p class="i2">   Thought he, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have some supper and fun, </p>
<p class="i4">     For of both I am really fond.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Then on to the box he sprang in a trice, </p>
<p class="i4">     And roused Mrs. Gobble from bed; </p>
<p class="i2">   She only had time to hiss once or twice, </p>
<p class="i4">     Ere he snapped off her lily-white head. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Her sisters at home felt anxious and low </p>
<p class="i4">     When poor Gobble did not appear, </p>
<p class="i2">   And Goosey, determined her fate to know, </p>
<p class="i4">     Went and sought all the field far and near. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   At last she descried poor Gobble&rsquo;s head, </p>
<p class="i4">     And some feathers, not far apart; </p>
<p class="i2">   So she told Ganderee she had found her dead, </p>
<p class="i4">     And they both felt quite sad at heart. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Now Goosey was pretty, but liked her own way, </p>
<p class="i4">     Like Gobble, and some other birds. </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no matter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if I only obey </p>
<p class="i4">     A part of my mother&rsquo;s last words.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So her house she soon built of nice red brick, </p>
<p class="i4">     But she only thatched it with straw; </p>
<p class="i2">   And she thought that, however the Fox might kick, </p>
<p class="i4">     He could not get in e&rsquo;en a paw. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So she went to sleep, and at dead of night </p>
<p class="i4">     She heard at the door a low scratch; </p>
<p class="i2">   And presently Reynard, with all his might, </p>
<p class="i4">     Attempted to jump on the thatch. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But he tumbled back, and against the wall </p>
<p class="i4">     Grazed his nose in a fearful way; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then, almost mad with the pain of his fall, </p>
<p class="i4">     He barked, and ran slowly away. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So Goosey laughed, and felt quite o&rsquo;erjoyed </p>
<p class="i4">     To have thus escaped from all harm; </p>
<p class="i2">   But had she known how the Fox was employed, </p>
<p class="i4">     She would have felt dreadful alarm; </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   For Gobble had been his last dainty meat,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     So hungry he really did feel,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   And resolved in his mind to accomplish this feat, </p>
<p class="i4">     And have the young goose for a meal. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So he slyly lighted a bundle of straws, </p>
<p class="i4">     And made no more noise than a mouse, </p>
<p class="i2">   Then lifted himself up on his hind paws, </p>
<p class="i4">     And quickly set fire to the house. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &rsquo;T was soon in a blaze, and Goosey awoke, </p>
<p class="i4">     With fright almost ready to die, </p>
<p class="i2">   And, nearly smothered with heat and with smoke, </p>
<p class="i4">     Up the chimney was forced to fly. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   The Fox was rejoiced to witness her flight, </p>
<p class="i4">     And, heedless of all her sad groans, </p>
<p class="i2">   He chased her until he saw her alight, </p>
<p class="i4">     Then eat her up all but her bones. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Poor Ganderee&rsquo;s heart was ready to break </p>
<p class="i4">     When the sad news reached her ear. </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;&rsquo;T was that villain the Fox,&rdquo; said good Mr. Drake, </p>
<p class="i4">     Who lived in a pond very near. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Now listen to me, I pray you,&rdquo; he said, </p>
<p class="i4">     &ldquo;And roof your new house with some tiles, </p>
<p class="i2">   Or you, like your sisters, will soon be dead,&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     A prey to your enemy&rsquo;s wiles.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So she took the advice of her mother and friend, </p>
<p class="i4">     And made her house very secure. </p>
<p class="i2">   Then she said,&mdash;&ldquo;Now, whatever may be my end, </p>
<p class="i4">     The Fox cannot catch me, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   He called at her door the very next day, </p>
<p class="i4">     And loudly and long did he knock; </p>
<p class="i2">   But she said to him,&mdash;&ldquo;Leave my house, I pray, </p>
<p class="i4">     For the door I will not unlock; </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;For you&rsquo;ve killed my sisters, I know full well, </p>
<p class="i4">     And you wish that I too were dead.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; said the Fox, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really tell </p>
<p class="i4">     Who put such a thought in your head: </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;For I&rsquo;ve always liked geese more than other birds, </p>
<p class="i4">     And you of your race I&rsquo;ve loved best.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="i2">   But the Goose ne&rsquo;er heeded his flattering words, </p>
<p class="i4">     So hungry he went to his rest. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Next week she beheld him again appear; </p>
<p class="i4">     &ldquo;Let me in very quick,&rdquo; he cried, </p>
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;For the news I&rsquo;ve to tell you&rsquo;ll be charmed to hear, </p>
<p class="i4">     And &rsquo;tis rude to keep me outside.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   But the Goose only opened one window-pane, </p>
<p class="i4">     And popped out her pretty red bill; </p>
<p class="i2">   Said she, &ldquo;Your fair words are all in vain, </p>
<p class="i4">     But talk to me here, if you will.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there will be a fair, </p>
<p class="i4">     All the birds and the beasts will go; </p>
<p class="i2">   So allow me, I pray, to escort you there, </p>
<p class="i4">     For you will be quite charmed, I know.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   &ldquo;Many thanks for your news,&rdquo; said Ganderee, </p>
<p class="i4">     &ldquo;But I had rather not go with you; </p>
<p class="i2">   I care not for any gay sight to see,&rdquo;&mdash; </p>
<p class="i4">     So the window she closed, and withdrew. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   In the morning, howe&rsquo;er, her mind she changed, </p>
<p class="i4">     And she thought she would go to the fair; </p>
<p class="i2">   So her numerous feathers she nicely arranged, </p>
<p class="i4">     And cleaned her red bill with much care. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   She went, I believe, before it was light, </p>
<p class="i4">     For of Reynard she felt much fear; </p>
<p class="i2">   So quickly she thought she would see each sight, </p>
<p class="i4">     And return ere he should appear. </p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   When the Goose arrived she began to laugh </p>
<p class="i4">     At the wondrous creatures she saw; </p>
<p class="i2">   There were dancing bears, and a tall giraffe, </p>
<p class="i4">     And a beautiful red macaw. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   A monkey was weighing out apples and roots; </p>
<p class="i4">     An ostrich, too, sold by retail; </p>
<p class="i2">   There were bees and butterflies tasting the fruits, </p>
<p class="i4">     And a pig drinking out of a pail. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Ganderee went into an elephant&rsquo;s shop, </p>
<p class="i4">     And quickly she bought a new churn; </p>
<p class="i2">   For, as it grew late, she feared to stop, </p>
<p class="i4">     As in safety she wished to return. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Ere, however, she got about half the way, </p>
<p class="i4">     She saw approaching her foe; </p>

<p class="i4">     For she knew not which way to go. </p>

<p class="i2">   But at last of a capital plan she bethought, </p>
<p class="i4">     Of a place where she safely might hide; </p>
<p class="i2">   She got into the churn that she just had bought, </p>
<p class="i4">     And then fastened the lid inside. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   The churn was placed on the brow of a hill, </p>
<p class="i4">     And with Ganderee&rsquo;s weight down it rolled, </p>
<p class="i2">   Passing the Fox, who stood perfectly still, </p>
<p class="i4">     Quite alarmed, though he was very bold. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   For the Goose&rsquo;s wings flapped strangely about, </p>
<p class="i4">     And the noise was fearful to hear; </p>
<p class="i2">   And so bruised she felt she was glad to get out, </p>
<p class="i4">     When she thought that the coast was clear. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So safely she reached her own home at noon, </p>
<p class="i4">     And the Fox ne&rsquo;er saw her that day </p>
<p class="i2">   But after the fair he came very soon, </p>
<p class="i4">     And cried out, in a terrible way,&mdash; </p>

<p class="i4">     For the hunters and hounds draw near!&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   So the Goose looked out, in order to see </p>
<p class="i4">     Whether Reynard was only in jest; </p>
<p class="i2">   Then, knowing that he in her power would be, </p>
<p class="i4">     She opened the door to her guest. </p>

<p>
<span class="sc">One</span> fine summer morning a Hen was picking peas in a farm-yard, under
a pea-stack, when a pea fell on her head with such a thump that she
thought a cloud had fallen. And she thought she would go to the court
and tell the king that the clouds were falling: so she gaed, and she
gaed, and she gaed, and she met a Cock, and the Cock said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And she said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Cocky-locky, the clouds are falling, and I am going to tell the
king.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>
And Cocky-locky said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Cocky-locky and Henny-penny they gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed,
till they met a Duck. So the Duck said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Cocky-locky and Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Ducky-daddles, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And Ducky-daddles said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Cocky-locky and Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Ducky-daddles, and Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny, they gaed, and they
gaed, and they gaed, till they met a Goose. So the Goose said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky and
Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Goosie-poosie, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>
And Goosie-poosie said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Goosie-poosie, and Ducky-daddles, and Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny,
they gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed, till they met a Turkey. So the
Turkey said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky,
and Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Turkey-lurky, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And Turkey-lurky said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I will go with you, Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky, and
Henny-penny.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So Turkey-lurky, and Goosie-poosie, and Ducky-daddles, and Cocky-locky,
and Henny-penny, they gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed, till they met
a Fox. So the Fox said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Turkey-lurky,
<!--Page 23 actually begins here ... close of paragraph moved up to keep together.-->
                                            Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles,
Cocky-locky, and Henny-penny?&rdquo;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<a name="image-0008"><!--IMG--></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>
And they said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Fox, the clouds are falling, and we are going to tell
the king.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
And the Fox said,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Come with me, Turkey-lurky, Goosie-poosie, Ducky-daddles, Cocky-locky,
and Henny-penny, and I will show you the road to the king&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
So they all gaed, and they gaed, and they gaed, till they came to the
Fox&rsquo;s hole; and the Fox took them all into his hole, and he and his
young cubs eat up first poor Henny-penny, then poor Cocky-locky, then
poor Ducky-daddles, then poor Goosie-poosie, and then poor Turkey-lurky;
and so they never got to the king to tell him that the clouds had fallen
on the head of poor Henny-penny.
